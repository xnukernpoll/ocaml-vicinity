(** [init my_nid my_data view view_len xchg_len period view_rnd distance send_cb recv_cb view_cb]
    initializes a VICINITY instance with the following configuration:
    - [my_nid] - ID of this node,
    - [my_data] - data associated with [my_nid] in view,
    - [view] - map of neighbour entries with peer ID as key,
    - [view_len] - max view length,
    - [xchg_len] - number of entries to exchange at each period,
    - [period] - gossip period, in seconds,
    - [view_rnd] - function that returns the current view
      of the random peer sampling service
    - [distance] - function to calculate distance between two nodes
    - [send_cb nid ndata xchg] - send [xchg] entries to node [(nid, ndata)]
    - [recv_cb my_nid my_data view recvd] - called after receiving entries
      during an exchange; allows rewriting [recvd] entries with the returned value
    - [view_cb my_nid my_node view] - called after the view has been updated

val recv :

(** [recv t rnid rdata recvd]
    receive entries from a peer and send response;
    run [recv_cb] with received entries, and
    return updated view *)
